# Design and Analysis of 3-Phase Inverter Using Sinusoidal ePWM Modulation Technique

## Introduction
This project focuses on the design and analysis of a three-phase inverter using the Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) technique. The inverter plays a crucial role in converting DC power into three-phase AC power and is widely used in motor drives, renewable energy applications, and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).

## Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM)
SPWM is the most commonly used PWM technique for controlling inverters. It generates gating signals by comparing a sinusoidal control signal with a triangular carrier waveform. The frequency of the sinusoidal control signal determines the desired inverter output frequency.

### Working Principle
- When `VcontrolA > Vtri`, `S1` is ON, and `VAN = Vd`.
- When `VcontrolA < Vtri`, `S2` is ON, and `VAN = 0`.
- When `VcontrolB > Vtri`, `S3` is ON, and `VBN = Vd`.
- When `VcontrolB < Vtri`, `S4` is ON, and `VBN = 0`.
- When `VcontrolC > Vtri`, `S5` is ON, and `VCN = Vd`.
- When `VcontrolC < Vtri`, `S6` is ON, and `VCN = 0`.

### Voltage Equations
The line-to-line voltages are computed as follows:
```math
V_{AB} = V_{AN} - V_{BN}
V_{BC} = V_{BN} - V_{CN}
V_{CA} = V_{CN} - V_{AN}
```

For the linear range of `m_a`, the fundamental component in `VAN` is:
```math
V_{AN} = \frac{m_a V_d}{2}
```

RMS value of `VAN`:
```math
V_{AN} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{m_a V_d}{2}
```

RMS line-to-line voltage:
```math
V_{LL} = \sqrt{3} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{m_a V_d}{2} \approx 0.612 \, m_a V_d
```

Solving for `Vd`:
```math
V_d = \frac{V_{LL}}{0.612 \, m_a}
```

Example Calculation (for `V_{LL} = 110V` and `m_a = 0.8`):
```math
V_d = \frac{110}{0.612 \times 0.8} = 224.67V
```

The nominal power rating `P` is:
```math
P = \sqrt{3} \, V_{LL} \, I_L
```
Given `R = 10Î©`, the RMS line current `I_L`:
```math
I_L = \frac{V_{LL}}{3R} = \frac{110}{3 \times 10} = 3.67A
```
Nominal Power:
```math
P = \sqrt{3} \times 110 \times 3.67 = 700W
```
